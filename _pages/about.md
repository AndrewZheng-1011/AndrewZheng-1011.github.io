Hi!<br>
My name is Andrew Zheng, and I am currently pursuing my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University. I currently work for the Distributed Intelligence and Robot Autonomy (DIRA) lab where my main research focuses on using Koopman operator for control on legged robots. A general overview of my areas of interest are nonlinear optimal control on robotic systems and the application of neural networks in state estimation, planning, and control.
