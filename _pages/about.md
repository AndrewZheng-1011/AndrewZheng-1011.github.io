Hi!<br>
My name is Andrew Zheng, and I just graduated with my M.S. Thesis in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University. During my M.S program, I worked at the Dynamics and Control for Autonomous and Intelligent System (DyCo AI) lab, where my main research was focused on motion planning and optimal control for legged systems in unstructured environments. You can see some of my work and my coworkers work at the DyCo AI Lab through this [link](https://cecas.clemson.edu/ugvaidya/home/). I am currently looking for open positions in regards to motion planning and control. I have experience in both algorithm implementation into real-time hardware, artificial neural networks, and real-time control.
