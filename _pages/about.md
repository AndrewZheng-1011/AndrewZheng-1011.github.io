Hi!<br>
My name is Andrew Zheng, and I am currently pursuing my M.S. Thesis in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University. I currently work for the Distributed Intelligence and Robot Autonomy (DIRA) lab where my main research focuses on using density formulation for save navigation on legged robots. A general overview of my areas of interest are planning and optimal control for robotic systems.
