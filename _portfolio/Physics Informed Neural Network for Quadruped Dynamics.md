<h2>Introduction</h2>
Quadruped leg dynamics are hybrid, nonlinear,  and high dimensional, causing many current approaches to modeling quadruped dynamics through lineaerization or reduced ordered models. This causes many traditional locomotion of legged robots consist of using hierarchal control to generate a feasible center of mass trajectory with a global planner used a reduced model and a lower level control to deal with higher fidelity models.
In this work, we (DIRA research lab) attempt to use Koopman operator theory as means to deal with the nonlinear hybrid leg dynamics of quadruped and neural networks as a a method to find the high dimensional lifting of the linear operator. This work focuses on system analysis of quadruped leg dynamics using the Koopman operator and showcasing the limits of the linear operator theory.
