<h2>Introduction</h2>
Quadruped leg dynamics are nonlinear, high dimensional system, and hybrid. Due to these nonlinearities introduced through the orientation of the leg, as well as nonlinearities introduced through the coupling between body dynamics and leg dynamics of quadrupeds, many traditional locomotion of legged robots consist of using hierarchal control to generate a feasible center of mass trajectory with a global planner and use lower level control to deal with higher fidelity control.
In this work, we (DIRA research lab) attempt to use Koopman operator theory as means to deal with the nonlinear hybrid leg dynamics of quadruped and neural networks as a a method to find the high dimensional lifting of the linear operator. This work focuses on system analysis of quadruped leg dynamics using the Koopman operator and showcasing the limits of the linear operator theory.
