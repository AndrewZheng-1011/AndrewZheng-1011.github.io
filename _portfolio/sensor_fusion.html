This mini project is inspired by the [github repository by jiawnhulu](https://github.com/jiawenhulu/Cone-Track-Car). This project incorporates their framework into gazebo simulation framework while improving the calibration process of 2D LiDAR and camera [ref]. Additional work of translating their camera hardware into camera sensors in gazebo simulations and modifying their traditional object detection parameters to be more suited for gazebo simulation was required to create a end to end functional path planning framework for the Husky.
